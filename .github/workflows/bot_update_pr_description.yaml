            ## ðŸ¤” Why

            Enables first-class support for delayed message delivery, reducing the need for external workarounds and making the system easier to use and reason about.

            Impact:
            Clients can now schedule message deliveries up to 10 minutes in the future via a simple API parameter, improving flexibility and reducing complexity.

            ## ðŸ’¡ How

            - Introduced visible_at field (epoch seconds, UTC) to MessageDeliveryPlan for delayed message processing.
            - Enforced a maximum delay of 10 minutes (MaxVisibleAtFutureDuration) in the domain validation logic.
            - Updated API payloads and handlers to accept visible_at as an integer and convert to time.Time for domain logic.
            - Updated documentation and examples to reflect the new field and its constraints.
            - Ensured /delivery-plan/instant endpoint ignores visible_at and always processes immediately.
            - Added/updated unit and service tests to cover new validation and propagation logic.
