# Repository Analysis Plan

## Overview
This Go repository contains a chatbot workshop application with an auto-reply system. It uses:
- **Framework**: Gin (HTTP server)
- **Structure**: Clean architecture with domain, application, and router layers
- **Purpose**: Auto-reply chatbot system with webhook triggers and organization management

## Current State Analysis

### âœ… Completed
- [x] Read project structure and key files
- [x] Analyzed main application entry point (cmd/app/main.go)
- [x] Reviewed domain models (auto_reply, organization)
- [x] Examined router and handler setup
- [x] Checked build configuration (Makefile, go.mod)

### ðŸ“‹ Todo Items

#### 1. Domain Layer Analysis
- [ ] Review auto_reply domain completeness (webhook_trigger.go)
- [ ] Analyze organization domain models (bot.go, business_hour.go, organization.go)
- [ ] Check common domain utilities (error handling, request ID)

#### 2. Application Layer Analysis
- [ ] Examine application initialization and dependency injection
- [ ] Review service layer patterns and interfaces

#### 3. Infrastructure Layer Analysis
- [ ] Analyze router middleware implementations
- [ ] Review handler implementations and API endpoints
- [ ] Check validation and parameter utilities

#### 4. Testing & Quality Analysis
- [ ] Review existing test coverage
- [ ] Analyze error handling patterns
- [ ] Check logging and monitoring setup

#### 5. Configuration & Build Analysis
- [ ] Review environment configuration patterns
- [ ] Analyze build and deployment setup
- [ ] Check dependency management

## Key Findings So Far

1. **Architecture**: Clean separation of concerns with domain, app, and router layers
2. **HTTP Server**: Gin-based REST API with health check endpoint
3. **Auto-Reply System**: Domain models for chatbot auto-replies with webhook triggers
4. **Organization Management**: Multi-tenant architecture with organization-scoped resources
5. **Configuration**: Environment-based config with CLI flags and environment variables
6. **Build System**: Make-based build with testing, linting, and mock generation
