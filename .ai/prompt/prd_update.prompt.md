I would like to update user stories and test cases in [the section name where stores user stories and test cases], based on the new conclusions in [the section name where stores meeting notes].

Follow the rules:
- Identify any critical clarifications or hidden assumptions that may affect implementation.
- Ask only **one question at a time** to avoid overwhelming the discussion.
- **Do not continue** until the current question is clearly answered.
- Offer **multiple-choice options** when possible to accelerate alignment and decision-making.
- If there are questions that cannot be answered or require broader input, add them to an **"Unresolved Questions"** list for stakeholder review. Do not assume or speculate.
- Keep the original format.
